🕵️‍♂️ Image Forgery Detection using Deep Learning Models
Detecting digital image tampering using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

Image forgery has become increasingly common with the rise of editing tools and social media. This project focuses on detecting manipulations in digital images such as copy-move, splicing, and tampering using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and advanced image processing techniques.

📘 Overview
Image forgery detection is the process of identifying whether an image has been digitally altered. In this project, we leverage deep learning techniques, particularly CNN architectures, to automate the detection of forged regions in images.

The model is trained to classify images as either authentic or forged, and localize manipulated regions where applicable.

🧠 Approach
Our forgery detection pipeline involves:

Image Preprocessing

Resizing, normalization, grayscale conversion (if needed)

Model Training

CNN architectures trained to detect forgery patterns

Evaluation

Accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and visual predictions

Detection Output

Binary classification + region highlighting (in some variants)

We’ve experimented with both custom CNNs and pre-trained models to benchmark performance.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy / Matplotlib

scikit-learn

📁 Dataset
We used publicly available and curated image datasets with forged vs. original image pairs:

CASIA Image Tampering Dataset

CoMoFoD Dataset (Copy-Move Forgery Detection)

Custom augmented samples for model generalization

Note: Some datasets may need to be downloaded manually and added to the Colab environment.

📈 Results
Achieved over 90% accuracy on validation sets.
